### Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any security concerns, place it in the "Issues" tab found (here)[https://github.com/definitely-nobody-is-here/BattleBoxes_Multiplayer/issues]
It will most likely take a few days to fix as I have no time. Or, if you have found a way to fix it, send a pull request.
It may be declined.
